This project lets a user upload an image, view all of it's metadata, edit the data and write it back to a new image.
Building this, I have used the power of Exiftool to handle reading and writing the data, HTMX handles the 'SPA feel' and Hyperscripts is used for some client based logic.
It's styled very basically with Bootstrap.
This is yet to 'go live' but I plan to Dockerise this app and deploy soon and build on it's features.
